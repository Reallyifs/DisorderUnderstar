# DisorderUnderstar
A Terraria mod.

Here is all about this "mod"'s code, take it.

NOT. ANY. UPDATE. ANYMORE.

# Who's made this?
I, name's "Really'if.s.".

Or you can call me "Reality_Killer", either.

(But many other people use this to call themselves, so I use my another name now.)

# Why you write this?
Emm...write this to myself?

I think this is the best way to explain all of this [.txt] (Actually, [.cs])

# Other things
In fact, I feel that if we can continue to improve it, it should be a good Mod...

But, it shouldn't me who did it.

Then, this is last what I can do for it.

Now, see ya in the days to come!
